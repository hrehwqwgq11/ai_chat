## Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

This project uses **pnpm** as the package manager for better performance and disk efficiency:

```bash
pnpm install
```

If you don't have pnpm installed:
```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

### 2. Set Up OpenRouter API (Optional)

For real AI responses, you'll need an OpenRouter API key:

1. Sign up at [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/)
2. Get your free API key
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
4. Add your API key:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

**Note**: The app works without an API key using mock responses for demonstration.

### 3. Run the Development Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to start chatting!
